                <p class="my-4 text-light align-middle">He began his early schooling at Pandacan and afterwards at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, where he was born on August 14, 1835 parents Venancio Zamora and Hilaria del Rosario. Under the Spanish caste system in use at the time, he was categorized as a Filipino mestizo. After completing his Bachiller en Artes, he moved to the University of Santo Tomas. Zamora received his Bachelor of Canon and Civil Laws degree on March 16, 1858. He enrolled in the Seminary of Manila to study for the priesthood.

            After Mass, Zamora had a habit of playing cards. He once received an invitation claiming that his friend had "Powder and Munitions"; "Powder and Munitions" signified that the player had a lot of money to bet with in gambler's parlance.
            <br><br>
            The Spaniards received this invitation on the night of the Cavite mutiny, which was commanded by a Filipino soldier, Sgt. La Madrid. The Spaniards used this invitation as evidence against Jacinto Zamora. Even though the evidence was insufficient, the court indicted them of encouraging the insurrection. They were convicted and given the death penalty by garrote. On February 17, 1872, in Bagumbayan Field in Manila, the execution was carried out. Witnesses have stated that Zamora was disoriented during his final days. As a consequence, he didn't say anything last before the garrote snatched the young priest's life.
