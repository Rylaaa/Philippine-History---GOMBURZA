                <p class="lead my-4">
                    In the 19th century, a Filipino Catholic priest was wrongly accused of mutiny by Spanish colonial authorities in the Philippines. In Manila, he was tried in a fake trial and promptly hanged alongside two other pastors known as the Gomburza. Gómes led the three priests and devoted his life documenting atrocities against Filipino priests.

            <h1><span class="text-success">Early Life</span></h1>
            <p class="my-4 text-light align-middle">Gómes was born in the Manila district of Santa Cruz on August 2, 1799. He was a tornatrás, a person with a mix of Austronesian, Chinese, and Spanish ancestry. Alejandro Francisco Gómez and Martina Custodio were his parents. He studied theology at the University of Santo Tomás after graduating from the Colegio de San Juan de Letrán. He was a seminary student studying for the priesthood in Manila.

                He was also the uncle of Dominador Gómez, an ilustrado patriot and labor activist.

            <p class="my-4 text-light align-middle">He was appointed chief priest of Bacoor, Cavite, on June 2, 1824. He taught agriculture and cottage industries in addition to taking care of the town's and church's spiritual needs.

    <h1><span class="text-success">Change of Name</span></h1>
    <p class="my-4 text-light align-middle">Gómes realized that he shared the name "Mariano Gómez" with a Spanish friar in Cavite and a priest from Cabuyao, Laguna, when he began parochial work. So he changed his last name from Gómez to Gómes, with the shift from the letter "z" to the letter "s" to symbolize his status as a Tagalista, or Tagalog language expert.<br><br>
        As a result, his name was formally changed to "Mariano Gómes de los ngeles," and he signed his name as "Mar Gómes de los ngeles" in his final will and testament.

    <h1><span class="text-success">Death</span></h1>
    <p class="my-4 text-light align-middle">Gómes was tried in a military court for treason, sedition, and active participation in the Cavite insurrection of 1872, and was sentenced to death by garrote. Along with Joaqun Pardo de Tavera, Máximo Paterno, and the friars José Burgos and Jacinto Zamora, he was sentenced to prison. The three friars were executed on February 17, 1872, in Bagumbayan Field, and have been known since then by the acronym Gomburza, which is a combination of their surnames.<br><br>Gómes was active in the publication of the periodical La Verdad before his execution (Spanish: "The Truth"). He was the eldest of the three priests, at 72 years old.
