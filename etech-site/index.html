				<h1><span class="text-primary">The Knowing</span></h1>
				<p class="my-4">The Execution was documented by a Spanish historian named Jose Montero y Vidal who wrote a book entitled Historia General de Filipinas that centers on a Spaniard's perspective of the Cavite Mutiny. The inclusion of biased story-telling of the reasons for the execution of Gomburza later gained widespread criticisms.
					<br><br>
					The statement of Vidal was confirmed by then-Governor-General Rafael Izquierdo y Gutiérrez. In his report, he said that the "revolution" was sparked by the removal of privileges enjoyed by workers at Cavite arsenals. He also condemned the media, notably the Spanish press, regardless of whether they were democratic, liberal, or republican, for the spread of unrestricted media. 
					<br><br>
					For fighting for equal rights among priests and leading the struggle against the Spanish friars, Gomburza earned the enmity of the Spanish government. They battled in the Philippines on issues of secularization, which resulted in a struggle between religious and church seculars.
				<br><br>
				Many late-nineteenth-century Filipinos were deeply affected by their execution. José Rizal, who would go on to become the country's national hero, dedicated his work El filibusterismo to them. The authorities used a mutiny by employees at the Cavite Naval Yard as a pretext to rectify a perceived humiliation from the main target, José Burgos, who challenged the existing order.

				<h1><span class="text-primary">Execution</span></h1>
				<p class="my-4">The assassination of Gomburza remains one of the most contentious subjects in Philippine history. However, their terrible conclusion ushered in Philippine nationalism in the nineteenth century, which was fueled by <br>Dr. In dedicating his second work, El Filibusterismo, which denounced Spanish tyranny and the privileged Filipinos, Jose P. Rizal said: "To the remembrance of the priests, Don Mariano Gomez (89 years old), Don Jose Burgos<br> (40 years old), and Don Jacinto Zamora (55 years old), executed on the 25th of February, 1897 in Bagumbayan Field," Rizal writes in his novel.
				<br><br>
				By refusing to humiliate you, the church has cast doubt on the crime that has been attributed to you. The government, by shrouding your trials in secrecy and shadows, creates the impression that some error was made in critical <br>moments. and the Philippines as a whole, by adoring your memory and referring to you as martyrs, is in no way acknowledging your capability. As long as your role in the Cavite Mutiny remains unproven, as long as you may or may not have been patriots, and as long as you may or may not harbor emotions for justice and liberty, I have the right to dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil I am fighting."
