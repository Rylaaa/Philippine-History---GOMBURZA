                        In the 19th century, a Filipino Catholic priest was accused of mutiny by Spanish colonial authorities in the Philippines. In Manila, he was convicted and hanged alongside two other pastors, Mariano Gomez and Jacinto Zamora, known as the Gomburza.

                <p class="my-4 text-light align-middle">José Burgos, christened José Apolonio Burgos y Garca, was born on February 9, 1837, in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, to Don José Tiburcio Burgos, a Spanish officer, and Florencia Garca, a Filipino mestiza mother. From the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and the University of Santo Tomas, he earned three undergraduate degrees with honors, two master's degrees, and two doctoral degrees. In Intramuros, he held his first mass.

                <p class="my-4 text-light align-middle">Burgos' nationalist ideas, which were enshrined in editorial writings and advocated for political and ecclesiastical changes to empower more native pastors, made him a target of civil authorities.
                    <br>
        </div>An anonymous paper condemning Church prejudice and presenting rebuttals to many canards about local clergy was published in Manila in 1864. Despite the lack of a signature, historians assume the paper was written by Burgos, based on its style and subject. Later in his life, Burgos wrote many signed essays in reaction to a series of anonymous written attacks against the Filipino clergy. Despite the fact that Burgos presented few new ideas, his name drew the attention of Spanish authorities, who claimed that the indigenous clergy was growing separatist.
        <br><br>
        Felipé Buencamino, a teenage student and Burgos' friend, was prosecuted in 1869 with disseminating nationalist propaganda on his school's campus in the form of flyers demanding academic independence. This charge was bolstered by a protest he conducted about being forced to speak Latin in class a few months previously. As a result, Buencamino and a few of his friends were sentenced to prison. Buencamino was released four months later with the help of Burgos, only to be told that because he had lost four months of school, he would have to hire a tutor to help him make up the lessons he had missed. Burgos was chosen by Buencamino.
        <br><br>
        Burgos had earned a reputation as a staunch supporter of the indigenous clergy by this time. His disputes on native priests' rights had morphed into discussions about race and nationalism. Due to his notoriety, he was eventually accused in a revolt in Cavite.

            José Burgos was a member of a confraternity that gathered in Padre Mariano's Santa Cruz residence. Agustn Mendoza, Máximo Paterno, and Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista were among those who attended, which was presided over by José Mara Basa. The group's purpose was to demand reforms, which were detailed in Eco de Filipinas, a Madrid-based publication.

        <p class="my-4 text-light align-middle">The trial of mutineer sergeant Bonifacio Octavo after the Cavite Mutiny on January 20, 1872 showed that a guy called Zaldua had been recruiting people for a revolt. Octavo testified that this individual claimed to be acting on Burgos' directions, but contradictory information during Octavo's cross-examination cast doubt on his credibility. Nonetheless, the evidence supported the governor-suspicions, general's and he blamed Burgos and two other priests, Jacinto Zamora and Mariano Gomez, for sedition.
